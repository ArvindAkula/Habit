# Habit

Intent to implement a particular habbit: Plan you make beforehand about when and where to act.This is called Intent to implement.
Eg: When situation X arises, I will perform response Y.

The simple way to apply stragey to your habits is below:
I will[BEHAVIOUR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]

One of the best way to build a mew habit is to identfiy a current habbit you already do each day and then stack your new behaviour on top.This is called habit stacking.
